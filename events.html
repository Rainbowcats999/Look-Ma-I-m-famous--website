            <ul>Events/challenges he faced: Abraham Lincoln's most significant challenge as President was navigating the Civil War, which included managing a deeply divided nation, raising and leading a large army, finding competent generals, financing the war effort, dealing with dissent on the home front, and ultimately deciding how to address the issue of slavery while preserving the Union; all while trying to prevent foreign intervention in favor of the Confederacy. 

                Key challenges Lincoln faced during the Civil War: 
                
                A Divided Nation: Balancing the needs of both the pro-slavery South and the abolitionist North, managing political factions within the Union.
                
                Military Leadership: Selecting and replacing generals who could effectively lead the Union army to victory.
                
                Raising an Army: Recruiting and training a large citizen army to fight the war.
                
                Financing the War: Securing funds to sustain the war effort.
                
                Foreign Intervention: Preventing foreign powers from recognizing the Confederacy.
                
                Slavery Issue: Deciding how to address slavery in a way that would both weaken the Confederacy and maintain support from border states.
                
                Constitutional Limits: Balancing the need for strong wartime measures with maintaining civil liberties.
                
                Other challenges Lincoln faced throughout his life: 
                
                Early Hardship: Growing up in poverty with limited education.
                
                Mental Health Struggles: Dealing with periods of severe depression.
                
                Political Opposition: Facing strong opposition from both within his own party and from Democrats.
                
                Public Perception: Managing his image and public opinion during a tumultuous time.
